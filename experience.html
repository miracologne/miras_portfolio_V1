            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in a small town near Frankfurt, Hesse. I moved to Cologne when I was 19. 
                In the beginning, it was quite a challenge because I didn't know anyone and many things were new to me. Today I feel very comfortable in Cologne and its culture.</p>
            <p>And soon I'd like to travel around the world to get to know different countries and cultures. </p>

            <h2>My Roots</h2>
            <p>I was born in Germany and have lived here all my life, but I am originally Turkish. My parents come from a city called Bursa from Turkey.</p>
            <p>Bursa is a large city in northwestern Turkey, located at the foot of the mountain 'Uludağ' and near the Sea of Marmara. The city is known for its mosques and historical sites from the early Ottoman Empire.</p>
